Creates a file. For more information, see [Create and manage files](/workspace/drive/api/guides/create-file). This method supports an */upload* URI and accepts uploaded media with the following characteristics: - *Maximum file size:* 5,120 GB - *Accepted
Media MIME types:* `*/*` (Specify a valid MIME type, rather than the literal `*/*` value. The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information, see [Google Workspace and Google Drive supported MIME
types](/workspace/drive/api/guides/mime-types).) For more information on uploading files, see [Upload file data](/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads). Apps creating shortcuts with the `create` method must specify the MIME type `application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`.
Apps should specify a file extension in the `name` property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `\"name\": \"cat.jpg\"` in the metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the
read-only `fileExtension` property populated with the extension originally specified in the `name` property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with
extension) based on the name. In cases where the extension is missing, Drive attempts to determine the extension based on the file's MIME type.","supportsMediaUpload":true,"flatPath":"files","path":"files","parameterOrder":[],"response":{"$ref":"File"},"mediaUpload":{"accept":["*/*"],"protocols":{"resumable":{"multipart":true,"path":"/resumable/upload/drive/v3/files"},"simple":{"path":"/upload/drive/v3/files","multipart":true}},"maxSize":"5497558138880"},"id":"drive.files.create","parameters":{"supportsTeamDrives":{"type":"boolean","description":"Deprecated:
